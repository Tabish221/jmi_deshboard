Often, these indicators are not exclusive to the US economy. Many economic indicators are used by multiple countries, while others are specific only to certain economies. Most currency traders are aware of indicators key to the US, but even more traders probably haven&#39;t the slightest clue or education concerning economic indicators specific to other economies. Such a view of fundamental analysis is tunnel vision at best. </p><table width="680" height="37" border="0" background="/assets/cimages/bg_1.jpg"><tr><td><span><strong>   A Global Economic Game Plan</strong></span></td></tr></table><br><p>The truth of the matter is that without a game plan attempting to master global economics would exhaust the most brilliant of minds. So, instead, look at it in the following manner: Every currency that you trade is paired with another currency for the purpose of establishing a comparative value. Consider it a battle of economies if you like, but however you choose to look at it, the point is that if trading the GBP/USD you had better know about not only the economic indicators that move the Dollar, but also of the key indicators that move the Pound. The dollar might be gathering strength across the board, but perhaps the Brits just released a Trade Balance report showing an increase in exports. As most economists know, increased exports tend to precede an increased demand for a nation&#39;s currency. <br> The following is an excerpt from &#39;FA1036 - Economics of the GBP&#39;: <br><em>An increased number of exports translate to an increase in the demand for said nation&#39;s currency, as other countries will be forced to exchange currency in order to purchase the exports. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is also largely impacted by the trade balance, as an increase in the demand for exports will increase the work load of domestic factories, thus increasing employment levels.</em> <br></p><div align="left"><p>The point is to have an eye on both of the economies, or currencies, that you are dealing in. A trader looking at only the economic indicators pertinent to the USD might have assumed that the Dollar would strengthen versus the Pound, as in our example it had been strengthening versus other currencies. But, given the announcement of increased exports in Britain, the dollar may in fact weaken versus the Pound simply as a result of the Pound&#39;s reaction to the GBP Trade Balance report. Had a trader been focused solely on the US economy, and solely on US economic indicators, this key fact would have been overlooked </p><p>  </p></div><table width="680" height="37" border="0" background="/assets/cimages/bg_1.jpg"><tr><td><span><strong>   Continuing Your Fundamental Analysis Education</strong></span></td></tr></table><br><p> As the Fundamental Analysis section of the university continues you will notice heavy emphasis is placed on the US economy. This is not an issue of pride, but rather is the case because of the position of the US economy globally; few can argue its place as an economic world super-power. Also, note that the Dollar is either the Base or the Cross currency in 7 major pairs: <br> USD/CHF ~ USD/JPY ~ EUR/USD ~ GBP/USD ~ USD/CAD ~ AUD/USD ~ NZD/USD<br> However, one should of course never focus on just the US economy. After a very close look at the USD the rest of fundamental analysis section of the university dissects (one course at a time) the economies that drive the currencies already listed above (GBP, JPY, EUR, CHF, NZD, AUD, CAD). Each currency has a very unique place in the global market, and moreover, each currency is impacted by various economic indicators. In the case of the EUR, many countries can potentially impact the standing of the EUR, meaning that traders should be aware of the economic indicators released by each of these nations. <br> Taken from &#39;FA1038 - Economics of the EUR&#39; consider the below: <br><em>Listed in alphabetical order the Euro is the official currency of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain - these countries comprise what is known as the Eurozone. The economic standing of any of the aforementioned countries can potentially impact the stability and price direction of the Euro.</em></p><p> </p><p>Don&#39;t Forget:</p><p>Traders need to be aware of major economic indicators around the entire globe... no other approach to fundamental analysis is completely sound. That said; push forward with your study of fundamental analysis; begin with the US economy, and then take a look at economics of each currency or region as they are outlined in this university! </p><div align="left"></div><p> </p></td></tr></table></div>',1)];var i=o(7215),s=(o(9669),o(2201));(0,n.iH)(),(0,s.tv)();const c={data:function(){return{site_title:"Economic Indicators",site_description:"",site_keywords:""}},mounted:function(){var e=this;(0,i.u)({title:(0,n.Fl)((function(){return e.site_title})),meta:[{name:"description",content:(0,n.Fl)((function(){return e.site_description}))},{name:"keywords",content:(0,n.Fl)((function(){return e.site_keywords}))}]})}};const h=(0,o(3744).Z)(c,[["render",function(e,t,o,i,s,c){return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)("div",a,r)}]])}}]);
