Their role is to help you develop your business and to ensure we provide the highest levels of service - and also to make sure your customers&#39; needs are met. </p><div class="speacer20"></div><h2> How it works - in outline</h2><p> Our Introducing Broker (IB) Service allows you to be remunerated for introducing new clients to us. As an IB you can introduce your clients to JMI Brokers and will receive commission on an ongoing basis via volume rebates or spreads. <br> We offer a total solution, from provision of the trading platforms, account opening, to execution and settlement of transactions, to issuing trading statements to your clients. Under this arrangement, for administrative purposes, your clients would be disclosed to JMI Brokers and deal directly with us, although we would not approach your clients directly. This leaves you free to concentrate on customer acquisition and the management of your own business. </p><h2> Other types of partner</h2><div class="speacer10"></div><h4>Introducing Agents</h4><p> Under this arrangement your clients would be introduced to JMI Brokers and trade our products in exchange for a fee. The client would become a customer of JMI. This method allows financial intermediaries to efficiently offer on exchange and off exchange (OTC) products to their client base. </p><div class="speacer20"></div><h4>Fund Managers</h4><p> We welcome partnerships with Fund Managers. After necessary appraisal of your fund we will be happy for you to trade on behalf of your clients on an undisclosed or disclosed basis and recommend your services to suitable existing clients of JMI Brokers .</p><div class="speacer20"></div><div class="speacer20"></div><a href="/en/become-partner" class="become-partner slide-live-button">Become Our Partner</a><div class="speacer20"></div></div></div>',2);var s=o(7215),i=(o(9669),o(2201));(0,t.iH)(),(0,i.tv)();const a={data:function(){return{site_title:"Partnership and White label",site_description:"",site_keywords:""}},mounted:function(){var e=this;(0,s.u)({title:(0,t.Fl)((function(){return e.site_title})),meta:[{name:"description",content:(0,t.Fl)((function(){return e.site_description}))},{name:"keywords",content:(0,t.Fl)((function(){return e.site_keywords}))}]})}};const c=(0,o(3744).Z)(a,[["render",function(e,r,o,t,s,i){return n}]])}}]);
