The Client shall hold full responsibility for all risks, financial resources used and the chosen trading strategy.</p><p>1.2. We highly recommend maintaining a Margin Level no lower than 1,000%, as well as placing Stop Loss orders to limit potential losses.&gt;</p><h4>2. Highly Volatile Instruments</h4><p>2.1.
