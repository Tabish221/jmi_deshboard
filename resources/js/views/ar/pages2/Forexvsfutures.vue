      <p class="style54">Forex Advantages </p>
    <p>Investors and speculators using the  Internet as an investment tool will find that the Forex market offers several  advantages over futures trading. <u> </u></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="/assets/cimages/fhgfh.jpg" /></p>
    <p>*200:1 is the entry leverage value.  Brokerages will have margin calls set at different levels, exact leverage may  vary. **The traders cost of doing business is called the Spread. It is the  difference between the bid and the ask price on your chosen currency pair. </p>
    <p class="style55">Benefits of Spot FX</p>
    <p>The benefits of spot Forex (cash  market) over futures, and more specifically currency futures, are considerable.  The dissimilarities between these investment vehicles range from philosophical  - such as the history of each, their target audience, and their relevance in  the modern Forex markets, to more tangible issues such as transactions fees,  margin requirements, liquidity level, and the technical and educational support  offered by the providers of each service. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style55">Higher  Volume = Better Liquidity</p>
    <p>The spot Forex market, or the cash  market, is certainly the most liquid market in the world. Of course, with such  incredible volume comes incredible liquidity. To seasoned traders this means  one thing: better execution. <br />
    After hours trading in the Futures  market has several limitations. In the US, for example, equities and futures  traders have access to ECNs (Electronic Communications Networks), also known as "matching systems". These networks are established to provide a method for traders  to buy and sell amongst each other. Such networks are usually not able to offer  as tight of spreads as would be offered during normal market hours, thus most  trades are not executed at a fair market price, subsequently there is no  guarantee that every trade will be executed. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style56">Easy  to Read Price Quotes</p>
    <p>Currency futures quotes are  inversions of the cash price. For example, if the cash price for USD/CHF is  1.7100/1.7105, the futures equivalent is .5894/ .5897 (a format only familiar  to future's traders). Spot prices, on the other hand, offer a simpler look at  the market. The bid price is always shown on the left and the ask price on the  right. The value of the base currency is always 1 (one). In the example above 1  US Dollar (USD) = 1.7100 CHF. <br />
    Currency futures' prices also have  the added complication a forward Forex component that takes into account a time  factor that is not necessary in the cash Forex Market. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style56">Higher  Risk</p>
    <p>The off-exchange retail foreign  currency market (or Forex market) has many differences, as outlined above.  However, one of the most significant factors is the element of risk. The Forex  market is the riskiest of all investment vehicles and is suitable only for  experienced traders. The higher leverage and volatility found in this market increase  the traders risk of loss. There is the potential to lose, all or more, of your  original investment.</p></td>
