                <h2 class="jmiblue"> Future (OTC) Currencies</h2>

  <p align="left"><br />
        <br />
          <span >Future (OTC) Currencies traded at JMI Brokers are: Canadian $, Australian $,  Euro, British pound, Japanese Yen and the Swiss Franc.</span><br />
          <br />
      The principle of buying and selling for future delivery has characterized  the markets for over a century and a half in physical commodities, mainly  metals and staple foodstuffs. It has also been the feature of the foreign  exchange markets, where prices can be agreed today for foreign currencies and  other financial instruments that can be delivered in the future.<br />
      <br />
      Futures Markets are markets in which participants can fix the price they will  pay or receive for bonds, shares and currencies and other financial products,  in the future (effectively the parties thus &quot;lock into&quot; a known  exchange rate/price). <br />
      <br />
      Trading is made by buying or selling futures contracts which are standardized  according to the quality, quantity, delivery time and location for each  instrument. A futures contract is specified with the month during which the  delivery or settlement is to occur i.e. if the product is gold and delivery is  in July then the price quoted is for July Gold.<br />
      There are three types of participants in futures markets, the one that wants  physical delivery, the hedger who wishes to protect himself/herself against  adverse movements in prices and the speculative investor. <br />
      The speculative investor has no intention of making or taking delivery of the  commodity but, rather, seeks to profit from a change in the price. Investors  buy a product when they anticipate rising prices i.e. entering long (and sell  that product later, at the higher price), or sell a product when they  anticipate declining prices i.e. entering short (and then buy that product  later, at the lower price). <br />
      <br />
      If you speculate in futures contracts and the price moves in the direction you  anticipated, then you will be making profit. Conversely, if prices move in the  opposite direction then losses are made. Speculators therefore are individuals  and corporations who seek to profit from anticipated increases or decreases in  futures prices.<br />
      For those individuals who fully understand and can afford the risks that are  involved, the allocation of some portion of their capital to futures trading  can provide a means of achieving greater diversification and a potentially  higher overall rate of return on their investments.</p>

      <p> A client believes that the EURO  Future Contract is due to rise in the future against US dollar, to get benefit  of the situation the client intends to buy EURO Future Contract.<br />
          EURO is quoted at 1.3580 - 1.3581,  the client buys 8 lots at 1.3581, the client requires minimum deposit of 1000 $  for each lot.<br />
  <br />
        EURO prices rise to 1.3625 - 1.3626,  the client is satisfied with his profit and wants to close his positions, he  therefore sells 8 lots of EURO Future at 1.3625, so the client has made profit  of 44 points (1.3625 - 1.3581 = 0.0044) . To calculate the profit we will do the  following:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left:20px;" start="1" type="1">
          <li>(Close price - open price) - (1.3625 - 1.3581 = 44       points)</li>
          <li>(points * pip value * number of lots) - (44 * 12.5 * 8       = 4400 US$)</li>
          <li>So the gross profit for the previous transaction is       4400 $.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>*Commission charges are NOT included  in the above calculations.</strong><br />

          <br />
          Buying&quot; to profit from the expected price increase  (&quot;Going Long&quot;)<br />
          Future instruments are traded with the forwarded month's  value. For example, assuming that now is January; tradable future contract for  Euro is March (ECMAR). Over the coming month, the client expects the price to  increase and decides to &quot;buy&quot;, &quot;x&quot; number of lots of ECMAR  (each lot representing 125,000 Euro) as he/she wishes and as the equity of  his/her trading account allows. This &quot;entry&quot; trade is called  &quot;Going Long&quot;.<br />
          <br />
          If the price of Euro appreciates, the client can  &quot;close&quot; the trade, with a profit, by &quot;selling&quot;,  &quot;x&quot; number of lots of ECMAR. The profit resulted from the particular  &quot;closed&quot; trade is calculated by subtracting the &quot;buying&quot;  price from the &quot;selling&quot; price and multiplying the difference by the  contract size of the particular currency pair and the number of lots traded.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Example 2 :</strong><br />
&quot;bought&quot; 1 lot  of ECMAR at 1.3350<br />
&quot;sold&quot; 1 lot of ECMAR at 1.3380<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Calculation:</strong><br />
  (&quot;selling price&quot; - &quot;buying price&quot;) * contract size *  number of lots = realized profit/loss<br />
          (1.3380 - 1.3350) * 125,000 * 1 = + USD375.-<br />
          <br />
&quot;Selling&quot; to profit from the expected price decrease (&quot;Going  Short&quot;)<br />
Future instruments are traded with the forwarded month's value. For example,  assuming that now is January, tradable future contract for Euro is March  (ECMAR). Over the coming month, the client expects the price to decrease and  decides to &quot;sell&quot;, &quot;x&quot; number of lots of ECMAR (each lot  representing 125,000 Euro) as he/she wishes and as the equity of his/her  trading account allows. This &quot;entry&quot; trade is called &quot;Going  Short&quot;.<br />
  <br />
  If the price of Euro depreciates, the client can &quot;close&quot; the trade,  with a profit, by &quot;buying&quot;, &quot;x&quot; number of lots of ECMAR.  The profit resulted from the particular &quot;closed&quot; trade is calculated  by subtracting the &quot;buying&quot; price from the &quot;selling&quot; price  and multiplying the difference by the contract size of the particular currency  pair and the number of lots traded <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Example 2:</strong><br />
&quot;sold&quot; 3 lots  of ECMAR at 1.3380<br />
&quot;bought&quot; 3 lots of ECMAR at 1.3350<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Calculation:</strong><br />
  (&quot;selling price&quot; - &quot;buying price&quot;) * contract size *  number of lots = realized profit/loss<br />
          (1.3380 - 1.3350) * 125,000 * 3 = + USD 1,125.-<br />
          <br />
        <em>Note: In the two examples above, in cases where the price of ECMAR moves in  the opposite direction than expected, the realized profit shown above becomes a  loss.</em> </p>
