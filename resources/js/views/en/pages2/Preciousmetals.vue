                <h2 class="jmiblue"> Spot Precious Metals traded at JMI: Gold and Silver</h2>
 <p align="left">      Nations around the world embraced gold and silver as a store of wealth and a  medium of international exchange. Individuals have sought to possess precious  metals as insurance against the day-to-day uncertainties of paper money. Gold,  silver, platinum and palladium constitute the majority of trading in precious  metals. <br />
      <br />
      Trading in precious metal futures market or spot market in a speculative manner  provides an important alternative to traditional means of investing in precious  metals such as gold bullion, coins, and mining stocks, and where substantial  profits, as well as losses can be made. Trading contracts in precious metals  also provide valuable trading tools for commercial producers and the users of  these metals. <br />
      <br />
      Precious metals are traded on the futures and spot markets in contracts (a  contract of gold is 100oz while a contract of silver is 5000oz). On the spot  market, precious metals are usually bought or sold based on a value date of 48  hours which can be rolled over on a daily basis thereafter. Trading on the  futures market is done by buying or selling precious metal for a specific  settlement date in the future.&nbsp;For example July Gold, can be bought in  March for July settlement. <br />

            </li>

            <li class="a" ><div>

 <p>The principle of buying and selling for future delivery has characterized  the markets for over a century and a half in physical commodities, mainly  metals and staple foodstuffs. It has also been the feature of the foreign  exchange markets, where prices can be agreed today for foreign currencies and  other financial instruments that can be delivered in the future.<br />
        <br />
      Futures Markets are markets in which participants can fix the price they will  pay or receive for bonds, shares and currencies and other financial products,  in the future (effectively the parties thus &quot;lock into&quot; a known  exchange rate/price). <br />
  <br />
      Trading is made by buying or selling futures contracts which are standardized  according to the quality, quantity, delivery time and location for each  instrument. A futures contract is specified with the month during which the  delivery or settlement is to occur i.e. if the product is gold and delivery is  in July then the price quoted is for July Gold.<br />
      There are three types of participants in futures markets, the one that wants  physical delivery, the hedger who wishes to protect himself/herself against  adverse movements in prices and the speculative investor. <br />
      The speculative investor has no intention of making or taking delivery of the  commodity but, rather, seeks to profit from a change in the price. Investors  buy a product when they anticipate rising prices i.e. entering long (and sell  that product later, at the higher price), or sell a product when they  anticipate declining prices i.e. entering short (and then buy that product  later, at the lower price). <br />
  <br />
      If you speculate in futures contracts and the price moves in the direction you  anticipated, then you will be making profit. Conversely, if prices move in the  opposite direction then losses are made. Speculators therefore are individuals  and corporations who seek to profit from anticipated increases or decreases in  futures prices.<br />
    For those individuals who fully understand and can afford the risks that are  involved, the allocation of some portion of their capital to futures trading  can provide a means of achieving greater diversification and a potentially  higher overall rate of return on their investments.<br />

          <li>If each contract consists of 100 oz (the value of the gold contract) then we must multiple 19.6 by 100, the profit therefore        will be 19.6 * 100 = 1960 $ per contract Gross profit: (1960 * 4 lots =        7840 $)</li>

    <p align="justify">A  client believes that Gold price against US Dollar is going to rise in the future.  To exploit the situation the client intends to buy GOLD (XAUUSD). <br />
      Spot  gold quoted 760.20 /760.90; the client buys 4 lots at 760.90. This required a  total margin of 4000 $ (margin of each lot is 1000 $). <br />
      As  expected spot gold price rises to 780.50/780.20; the client decides to sell  these 4 lots (close his positions). So he sells 4 lots at 780.50. <br />

      The  silver didn't move in the client's favor and its price now is 13.22/13.23, the  clients decides to buy 6 lots of silver future contract (close his positions),  so he buys 6 lots at 13.23. <br />
